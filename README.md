# Sudent Pattern Prediction
The aim of this project is to explore data mining techniques to discover interesting patterns in students' academic performance with an interactive web application.

## Dataset 
The data was obtained from the Department of Computer and Information Science at Covenant University, Nigeria. The data included examination records from the first semester in the 2020/2021 academic session.
A questionnaire was also used in the analysis. The questionnaire was distributed to 50 final year students and lecturers of the department. The questionnaire aimed to get expert feedback on the factors that could affect a student's performance in a course. The factors considered for this analysis are course structure (hard, moderate, or easy), course nature (mathematical, theoretical, abstract, programming, or practical), and curriculum broadness (extensive, moderate, or short).

The dataset has been preprocessed and the resulting datasets ('200_viz.csv', '300level_MIS_assoc.csv', 'association1.csv') can be viewed in the 'model_alg' folder. Dummy datasets have also been provided and can also be located in the 'model_alg' folder.
